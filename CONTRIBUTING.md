## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
1. **Check the issue tracker**
   Before reporting a bug, check if it’s already been reported.
2. **Open a new issue**
   If no existing issue matches your findings, open a new issue.
    - Provide a clear description of the bug.
    - Include steps to reproduce the bug, along with any relevant logs or screenshots.
    - Specify the environment (e.g., operating system, browser version) if relevant.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements
1. **Search existing issues**
   Similar to reporting bugs, search the issue tracker to see if your feature or enhancement has already been discussed.
2. **Open a feature request**
   If it’s a new idea, open an issue titled “Feature Request: [Your idea]” and describe:
    - What problem does this feature solve?
    - What are its potential use cases?
    - Any suggested implementation details?

### Submitting Pull Requests
1. **Fork the repository**
   Create your own copy to work on.
2. **Create a new branch**
   It’s best practice to name your branch something descriptive, like `feature/new-thing` or `fix/bug-description`.
3. **Make your changes**
    - Keep commits focused on a single goal.
    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
4. **Test your changes**
    - Ensure all tests pass locally.
    - Consider adding new tests if you introduce new features or fix bugs.
5. **Open a pull request**
    - Reference any related open issues in your pull request description.
    - Provide a summary of the changes you made and why they’re important.
6. **Review & discussion**
    - Be prepared to discuss your changes and make revisions if needed.
    - The maintainers may request changes or suggest improvements.
7. **Merging**
    - Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer.

## Style & Conventions
- **Documentation**: Keep inline documentation clear and concise.
- **Code Structure**: Follow any existing code patterns or architectural decisions in the project.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- **Linting / Formatting**: Run the linting and formatting tools before opening a pull request.
